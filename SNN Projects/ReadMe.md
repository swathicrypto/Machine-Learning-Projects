# SNN-Torch Research & Exploration

This research revolves around Graph Connectivity: from a trained spiking neural network (SNN), using the notion of adjacency matrices, represent connectivity of neural network layers via graph networks.

All code was written using Python version 3.10.11 using Google's Colaboratory. Otherwise, code can be run via Jupyter Notebook. Both the Jupyter Notebook and Python files are included.
