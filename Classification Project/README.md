# Classification Project

This project tracks the movement of the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar in the next hour based on the previous hour's information for these securities. Note: the dataset and tf.records file used in this model can be retrieved on request, but are too large to attach here. The relevant files are: "createSavedDataset.ipynb", "customImputeLayerDefinition.ipynb", "buildAndTrainModel.ipynb", and "mySavedModel.zip".

All code was written using Python version 3.10.11 using Google's Colaboratory. Otherwise, code can be run via Jupyter Notebook.
