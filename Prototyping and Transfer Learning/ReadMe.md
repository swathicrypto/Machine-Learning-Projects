# Prototyping and Transfer Learning Project

This exercise creates a trained model centered around the detection of bird, squirrel and chipmunk presence; inference of bird type (of 358 types) from still images through two vision architectures classifying still images. Note: the dataset, tf.records files, and additional assets used in this model can be retrieved on request, but are too large to attach here. The relevant files are: "buildAndTrainBirdsVsSquirrels.ipynb", "preprocessDefinition.ipynb", "Preprocessing.ipynb", "birderModel.ipynb", and "saved_model.pb".

All code was written using Python version 3.10.11 using Google's Colaboratory. Otherwise, code can be run via Jupyter Notebook. Both the Jupyter Notebook and Python files are included.
